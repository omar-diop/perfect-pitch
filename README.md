# Perfect Pitch

This open-source project, created out of curiosity, aims to provide a web-based tuner tool, allowing users to tune their instruments from their web browsers.

## Overview

Perfect Pitch leverages TypeScript, React, and Next.js to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for tuning instruments.
The tuner utilizes algorithms such as autocorrelation to accurately detect and display the pitch of the detected note.
